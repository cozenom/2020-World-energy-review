        <h2>Intro: </h2>
        <p>
          The covid pandemic has had a massive impact on our lives. The effects of this are also felt in energy markets
          where global primary energy consumption fell by 4.5% and carbon emissions fall by 6.3% in the largest
          year-to-year decline in over 50 years. The issue of oil from Russia, has also become a problem recently as
          well. All the while the world aims to be moving towards greener more renewable energy sources.

          With our visualizations we want to show what sources the power we are consuming to generate our power and to
          show features and historic trends between countries.

        <h2>1. Worldwide Power Consumption Trends</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Lets start off by taking a look at the big picture. In this case that is our entire total global power
            consumption. As the population of the planet grows and technology advances, there is a clear need for more
            energy resulting in a steady increase in consumption as well.

            In 2020, largely as a result of the covid pandemic was the first year in a while that global energy
            consumption has fallen (by almost 5%). This decline was mostly due to the drop in demand for oil which
            dipped 15 EJ (almost 9% since the previous year). With the current ongoing war in Ukraine and Oil being a
            hot topic I belive this trend will continue as well. Despite this dip in consumption, renewable and hydro
            energy remained unaffected and with renewables alone tripling over the course of the last 10 years. Still,
            it remains a rather small proportion of total energy consumption but with the world becoming more climate
            active and various climate agreements I hope it can also continue in the future.

        <p>
          Next, we can take a closer look and explore the individual regions & countries. Historically the US was the
          leading energy consumer until they were overtaken by China in 2009 who have led the world since then. India
          has also been steadily climbing the ranks in the meantime as well.

          A clear trend that is visible on the visualizations below is that more developed nations also have higher
          energy consumption. This obviously makes a lot of sense. However it did not mean that they were using higher
          proportions of cleaner energy sources. In fact while the general overall trend is that renewable energy
          consumption is increasing, only around half of the highest 25 consumers in 2020 consume more than 10% of clean
          (hydro or renewable) energy. The leaders in that regard are Brazil with over 40% of their power coming from
          clean sources (most of which is from hydro) and then Canada with almost 30%.

        <h2>Carbon Dioxide emission on a global scale</h2>
        <div class="section-column">
          <div class="left">
            <p>
              Carbon Dioxide is the gas emitted by humans. This includes gasses like methane, nitrous oxide, and
              fluorinated
              gases
              methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. These gasses get trapped in the atmosphere, causing global
              warming. As most people know the world is collectively trying to reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions to slow
              down
              the impact it has on global warming.

              Gas flaring is the practice of burning gas associated with oil extraction. this has been done since the
              beginning of oil production. This process is very wasteful and polluting to the environment but the major
              reason why we still do gas flaring is that it's relatively safe and the export of gas requires an
              economically
              viable market as the company doing the oil production needs to capture, transport, process, and sell the
              gas.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <p>
              As we can see from the charts below on a World scale Carbon Dioxide emissions didn't really drop down over
              the
              last 20 years. We saw a drop in natural gas and total flaring in the 1980s but not from non-flaring
              emissions.
              And after the drop to 195 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, we saw an increase to 300 million tonnes of
              carbon
              dioxide in the year 2020.

            <p>
              If we now look at a per country visualization we can observe that all south/central American countries
              have a slight increase in carbon dioxide emissions while we saw the production in most North American
              countries double and we saw a decrease in most European countries.

              Filtering by country is done by selecting the desired country in the checkbox list below. while the
              filtering of emission Type is done by selecting the desired emission type.

              As we filter the same data on a per year bases we can observe that the carbon dioxide emission has
              stabilized in recent years. In the 1970's we observe that no western countries are in the list of top 10
              list of countries that produce carbon dioxide emissions from flaring while in 2020 we see the United
              States of America as the 4th largest producer and we see China coming up in the top 10 of carbon dioxide
              emission production.

              The following network represents the trade oil crude/produced oil in the Year 2020. The nodes size
              represents the total import and export a country does while the line thingness of the links represents the
              trade of those countries. When hovering over a country it shows the import of oil with green line color
              and export with a red color. Hovering also reveals more info on the right side of the chart for easier
              reading and specific values of trades. The legend has a hoverable state to reveal the countries un that

              As most people know the oil trade is an important factor of the world economy. The price of oil can vary a
              lot depending on supply and the demand. Like in 2014 when Saudi Arabia decided not to scale down there
              production and the US also kept producing its steady amount we got an over production and prices fell
              sharply. It would be interesting to do the same study about the global trade of crude/produced oil in the
              year 2022 as we have a war going on and this would drastically change trade relations between countries.
